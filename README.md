# compliment-generator

A positive twist on your common insult generator.

This is my first Ruby app, and I have little to no idea what I'm doing. Suggestions on how to do things better are welcome.

## New Features

28 Feb 2015
* Use JavaScript to get compliments, instead of by page reload.
* dynamic accoutrements
* compliment counter
* busted a move

22 Feb 2015
* Responsive layout allows you to compliment on the go!

18 Feb 2015
* It works!


## CSS Magic

Some of the fancy pure-CSS imagery in this app modifies code found in articles by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#seigaiha) (seigaiha background), [James Koster](http://jameskoster.co.uk/snippets/pure-css-3d-ribbon/) (horizontal ribbon), and [simurai](http://simurai.com/archive/buttons/) (bon bon button).

The mobile-responsive vertical ribbon layout is a new design that I will continue to refine. Updates to it will likely be published here first.

## Forthcoming features:

* CSS cleanup
